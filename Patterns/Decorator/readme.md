1. When to use it?

The decorator pattern attaches additional responsabilities to an object dinamically (at runtime) and not necesarily at compile time. It also provides a flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionalities.

It is a wrapper that can be used to completely define new functionalities to a base object, modify the behavior/result of existing methods/functionalities or even block or restrict the use of existing functionalities (to deprecate functions/methods)
