1. When to use it? Fa√ßade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

2. Motivation. From the Single responsability principle, there may be many classes and to do a significant task, many of these classes have to called and the interaction becomes quite comples. In such scenario, one may create a facade that exposes specific behaviors/interaction of all these independant classes.
