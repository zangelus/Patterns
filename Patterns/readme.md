In each folder there will be a readme file that exaplains the pattern.

SOLID principles: 
S - Single Responsability principle:
A class should have only a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
O - Open/Close principle:
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
L - Liskov substitution principle:
I - Interface segregation princilple:
No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
D - Dependency inversion principle:
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
