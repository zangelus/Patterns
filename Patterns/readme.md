In each folder there will be a readme file that exaplains the pattern.

SOLID principles: 
S - Single Responsability principle:
A class should have only a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
O - Open/Close principle:
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
L - Liskov substitution principle:
I - Interface segregation princilple:
No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
D - Dependency inversion principle:
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.


Patterns that are very similar: Adapter, Facade, Proxy, Decorator. The differences are: 
Adapter : Makes interfaces compatible. Making two interfaces that are not compatible, compatible.
Facade : It hides complex logic. Create a layer that exposes in a simpler form the complex interaccions between different objects. It hides complex logic.
Proxy: Intersects a call and control the access to the object.  Adding an intermediary object between client and server for a given purpose as security, load balance, intersect data, etc.
Decorator: Adds behavior to a particular object without having to change or open the object.
